ReadMe - Hospital Application - Dylan Bednar and Josh Devenyi

_The “Hospital Application” is a data management system designed for use by both hospital staff and patrons.  
Specified admin users can log in to create new entries, as well as adjust or delete existing ones. 
Doctors and patients are listed along with any relevant associated procedures. 
Doctors, patients and rooms are each unique entities, the procedures database uses existing information from the other three to edit and create new procedures._



**Dylan Bednar’s Contributions:**
  - Patients data controllers, controllers, CRUD & views
  - Procedures data controllers, controllers, CRUD & views
  - New patient/doctor/procedure/room form structure
  - Authorization / Admin function for Patients & Procedures
  - Dynamic patient detail view (showcases associated procedures)

**Josh Devenyi’s Contributions:** 
  - Doctors data controllers, controllers, CRUD & views
  - Rooms data controllers, controllers, CRUD & views
  - Overall page styling & structure design.
  - Authorization / Admin function for Doctors & Rooms

**Issues we are working on:**
  - Time functionality for procedure selection
  - Weird dropdown bug when a user is logged in where the header covers a portion of the top of the page.
